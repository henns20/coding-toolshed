/* functions jq's

1. function declaration patterns 
ES5 

a. function declaration notation
	function f () {...}
	one advantage: hoisting
	 of this is the hoisting of function declarations in a script. The function can be declared lower in the program - but used in the beginning. Allowing for a better organization. 

b. regular variable definiton  //  or  function expression
var f = function() {...}

The call stack
