### Why and when use a switch case statment?

[stackOverflow aswer covers it well - esp dasblinkenlight](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/154500/how-is-a-switch-statement-better-than-a-series-of-if-statements)

	1. Importance of one variable: it is more descriptive - telling the reader code can branch many ways based on 1 variable.  
	2. Compiles differently  - less cycles on the compiler - * i think i get this * but will leve it for now. ref the so.
